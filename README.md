4sq-places-suggest
==================

Suggest places based on foursquare data

(1) First go to https://foursquare.com/developers/apps and add your app.

(2) While adding your app you will get Client ID and Client Secret that will be used to make Foursquare API calls.

(3) Go to JFFoursquarePlacesAutocompleteQuery.h in project and set your Client ID and Client Secret Appropriately.

(4) Just copy JFFoursquarePlacesAutocompleteQuery.h, JFFoursquarePlacesAutocompleteQuery.m,
JFFoursuareAutocompletePlace.h and JFFoursuareAutocompletePlace.m to your project and you are your own way to go :-)

(5) If you want to avoid extra coding you can also use existing JFFourSquarePlacesViewController.h 
and JFFourSquarePlacesViewController.m.
 
 Happy XCoding!!
